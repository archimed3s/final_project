# final_project
The final project based on content library

Technology that I used:
1. Template - handlebars.js
2. Data Base - data.json
3. It is used ajax for communication json with template.
4. Less preprocessor is used to style the site.
5. It works in all browsers. Plus minimal support IE8+.
6. There is done search by title to a file json.
7. There is done switching to a single element.
8. Working breadcrumbs for a site map.
9. There is done image gallery page.
10. All this made as SPA - Single Page Aplication.
