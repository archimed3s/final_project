# Final project
The final project based on content library

Technology that I used:
Template - handlebars.js
Data Base - data.json
It is used ajax for communication json with template.
Less preprocessor is used to style the site.
It works in all browsers. Plus minimal support IE8+.
There is done search by title to a file json.
There is done switching to a single element.
Working breadcrumbs for a site map.
There is done image gallery page.
All this made as SPA - Single Page Aplication.
